## USECASE DIAGRAM:
A Library Management System (LMS) use case diagram visually represents the interactions between users and the system's key functionalities. In this diagram, actors like Librarians, Members, and Admins are connected to various use cases, showing the system's operations. Librarians can manage books, members, and lending activities, while members can search for books, borrow, and return them. Admins might have broader privileges, such as managing user roles. This diagram helps clarify the system’s functional requirements, supporting efficient design and implementation.

## ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:
This diagram depicts the Activity diagram of Libary Management System. It starts with entering the library and showing an ID, which is then verified. After verification, the user inquires about a book and searches for it. Upon finding the book, they take it and make an entry in the "take away" register. The final steps involve reading and understanding the book and ensuring it is returned on time. The chart visually organizes each step in sequence to illustrate the library borrowing process.

## CLASS DIAGRAM:
A class is drawn as rectangle box with three compartments or components separated by horizontal lines. The top compartment holds the class name and middle compartment holds the attribute and bottom compartment holds list of operations.

## SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:
The image shows a sequence diagram illustrating the interaction among three participants: a Reader, a Librarian, and a System Admin, in the process of borrowing a book from a library.
Reader enters the library and shows their ID. The Librarian performs ID verification, and once successfully verified, the reader makes an inquiry about a book.The Librarian consults the System Admin for guidance, who assists in locating the book.The book is then found and given to the reader.The reader takes the book, and the librarian makes an entry in the records.Finally, the reader is provided with the book and, after reading, returns it to the librarian before exiting the library.

## COMMUNICATION DIAGRAM:
A collaboration diagram is similar to sequence diagram but the message in number format. In a collaboration diagram sequence diagram is indicated by the numbering the message. A collaboration diagram, also called a communication diagram or interaction diagram, A sophisticated modeling tool can easily convert a collaboration diagram into a sequence diagram and the vice versa. A collaboration diagram resembles a flowchart that portrays the roles, functionality and behavior of individual objects as well as the overall operation of the system in real time.

## PACKAGE DIAGRAM:
A package diagram is represented as a folder shown as a large rectangle with a top attached to its upper left corner. A package may contain both sub ordinate package and ordinary model elements. All uml models and diagrams are organized into package. A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the dependencies between the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) shows a grouping of elements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML PDs can be used to show groups of classes in Class Diagrams (CDs), groups of components or processes in Component Diagrams (CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment Diagrams (DPDs).

## Result:
Thus, UML diagram for Library management system is successfully created using StatUML.
